# Graph

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of `vertices` (or `nodes`) potentially connected by line segments named `edges`.

## Challenge

creating a `Graph` represented as `adjacency list` and provide the following methods :

- add node:
  - Arguments: value
  - Returns: The added node
  - Add a node to the graph
- add edge:
  - Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
  - Returns: nothing
  - Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
  - If specified, assign a weight to the edge
  - Both nodes should already be in the Graph
- get nodes:
  - Arguments: none
  - Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
- get neighbors:
  - Arguments: node
  - Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
    - Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
- size:
  - Arguments: none
  - Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

## Approach & Efficiency

I took the implementation path, where I start writing code and tests my result step by step.

### Efficiency

Time:

- add node : O(1)
- add edge : O(1)
- get nodes : O(n)
- get neighbors : O(n)
- size : O(n)

Space:

- add node : O(n)
- add edge : O(n)
- get nodes : O(n)
- get neighbors : O(n)
- size : O(1)

## API

#### add node

Provide a `Vertex` and this method will add the vertex to the `Graph`.

ex) `graph.addVertex(<vertex name>)`

#### add edge

Provide a `starting vertex` and an `ending vertex` one to add an `edge`

ex) `graph.addDirectedEdge(<starting vertex> , <ending vertex>)`

#### get nodes

Call this method to get an array of all `node`s / `vertex`es in a `Graph`

ex) `graph.getVertexes()`

return: Array of Objects.

#### get neighbors

Call this method to get an array of all `edge`s in a `Graph`

ex) `Graph.getEdges()`

return: Array of Strings.

#### size

Call this method to get the number of nodes in a `Graph` (Graph size)

ex) `Graph.size()`

return: number.
