# Singly Linked List
a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail)

## Challenge
Write a linked-list and test if it's working  
Challenge Type: New Implementation

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
the approach that i took was using head and tail to make a linked list, i used this approach because its direct to the point.
the Big O time for this approach was O(1) for inserting nodes and O(n) for searching about value in the node inside the linked list.

the Big O space for this approach was O(n).

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
**- insert method :**
- Input: Value.
- Output: Linked list having the node with the inputed value.
- Uses: Used to insert a node with the inputed value inside the linked list.

**- includes method :**  
- Input: Value.
- Output: The node with the inputed value.
- Uses: Used to find the node with the inputed value inside the linked list.

**- toString :**   
- Input: Nothing.
- Output: All the nodes's values inside the linked list.
- Uses: Used to see all the nodes's values inside the linked list.
