## Challenge  
- Write a function called validate brackets, representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced

## Approach & Efficiency  

### Approach   
1. I understood the problem first
1. I imagined how the results should be
1. I made a visual representation.

1. I wrote the code
1. I made the tests   

### Efficiency
- Space :  
  - O(1)
- Time :  
  - O(n)
