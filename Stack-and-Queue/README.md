# Stacks and Queues
`Stacks` works on the principle of **FILO**, where the first item inter the stack will be the last item to get out.

`Queues` works on the principle of **FIFO**, where the first item to enter the queue will be the first item to get out of it.

## Challenge
- create a class called `Node` that holds two properties, value and next.
- create a class called `Stack` that holds one property, front. After that :
  - create a `push` method to add a node to the end of the stack.
  - create a `pop` method to remove a node from the the front of the stack.
  - create a `peek` method to return the front node of the stack, and exception if the stack is empty
  - create a `is empty` method to check if 
- create a class called `Queue` that holds one property, front. After that:
  - create a method called `enqueue` to add a node to the back of the queue, with time performance of O(1).
  - create a method called `dequeue`to remove the front node of the queue, with time performance O(1).
  - create a method called `peek` to return the front value of the queue.
  - create a method called `is empty` to check if the queue is empty.

## Approach & Efficiency
For the stack my approach was straight forward, create a class with one property and all of its methods. The time performance was O(1) for all methods, and space performance was O(1) for `push` and `pop`.  
For the queue I added another property called `rear` to the class and set the its value to be the last node in the queue (newest node). The time performance was O(1) for all methods, and space performance was O(1) for `enqueue` and `dequeue`.

## API  

1. Stack:  
  - To instantiate a new stack => `const || let <name> = new Stack()`
  - To add a node to the front of the stack => `<name>.push(<value>)`
  - To remove a node from the front of the stack => `<name>.pop()`
  - To peek on the front value of the stack => `<name>.peek()`
  - To check wether the stack is empty or not => `<name>.isEmpty()`
2. Queue:
  - To instantiate a new queue => `const || let <name> = new Queue()`
  - To add a node to the back of the queue => `<name>.enqueue(<value>)`
  - To remove a node from the front of the queue => `<name>.dequeue()`
  - To peek on the front value of the queue => `<name>.peek()`
  - To check wether the queue is empty or not => `<name>.isEmpty()`
